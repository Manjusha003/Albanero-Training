# indexing in list

# list=[7,9,2,8,1,0]
# print(list[0])
# print(list[-1])
# print(list[:])
# print(list[:2])

# slicing in list (It reaturns a new List)
# list=[78,90,56,5,43,67]
# print(list[:])  # return shallow copy of list
# print(list[2:])
# print(list[:4])
# print(list[2:5]) # 2 is included and 5 is excluded



# concatenation:
# list1=[6,8,2,90,13,44]
# list2=[7,3,1,3,91,9]
# print(list1+list2)

#Unlike strings, which are immutable, lists are a mutable type, i.e. it is possible to change their content:
# list=[8,5,2,7,8,3,9]
# print(list)
# list[2]=677
# print(list)


#Add new items at the end of the list, by using the append() method
# list=[8,5,2,7,8,3,9]
# list.append(78)
# print(list)


# characters=['a','b','c','d','e']
# characters[0:]=["A","B","C","D","E"]
# print(characters)
# characters[2:4]=["c","d"]
# print(characters)


# nest lists
# l1=[2,3,4,5,6]
# l2=['a','b','c','d']
# l3=[l1,l2]
# print(l3)


# Fibonacci series:
# a, b = 0, 1
# while a<10:
#     print(a)
#     a,b=b,a+b

#The keyword argument end can be used to avoid the newline after the output, or end the output with a different string:

# a,b=0,1
# while a<500:
#     print(a, end=',')
#     a, b = b, a+b



# list=[89,"manjusha"]
# print(list)
