#To avoid getting an error, you might want to check if the file exists before you try to delete it

# if os.path.exists("file.txt"):
#   os.remove("file.txt")
# else:
#   print("The file does not exist")


# To delete an entire folder, use the os.rmdir() method:




# f=open('inputoutput.py', 'w')



# with open('inputoutput') as f:
#     read_data = f.read()
#     f.closed

# f = open('Day4/first', 'w')
# print(f.write("Hello"))

#Methods of File Objects

# f=open('Day4/first.py','w')
# f.write("Welcome")
# print(f.read())


#The JSON format is commonly used by modern applications to allow for data exchange. Many programmers are already familiar with it, which makes it a good choice for interoperability.

# import json
# p=json.dumps([1,"hello","bye"])
# print(p)
